For the packet trace, if you load it into wireshark and filter with "tcp.port eq 4586" You will be able to look through and see the two packets exchaged between the two computers with new keys and a final ready message sent before data is actually tranmitted. Then if you look at the packet that was transitted to 172.... at time 4.644011660 you will be able to see the encrypted messages as a bunch of numbers. If you are curious what the message was, it was a description of the current weather.
